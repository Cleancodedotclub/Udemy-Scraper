The Python Udemy Scraper GitHub repo is a project that allows users to scrape and extract course information from Udemy's website. The scraper can extract course names, descriptions, ratings, number of students, price, and more. The data is then stored in a CSV file for easy manipulation and analysis. The project uses the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to scrape the data, and includes error handling and progress tracking functionality. This scraper can be useful for anyone looking to analyze Udemy's course offerings or to compare course prices and ratings.
